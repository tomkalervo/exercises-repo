# Computation Tree Logic - Model Checker
The application takes a model with a set of states and their relation. It then tests if a provided CTL-forumla checks out. 

# An example, the robot grass cutter
robotg.txt in the represenation of data from the model in robotcutter003.png. In robotg.txt there also is a forumla. When robotg.txt is used as input in the modelchecker we either get true or false depending if the formula checks out.
